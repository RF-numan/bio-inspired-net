# Biologically Inspired Neural Network (BIC)

A biologically inspired neural network built from scratch using NumPy — featuring Xavier initialization, multiple activation functions, and clear training logic. Great for learning how ANNs work under the hood.

## Features

- 🧬 Biologically Inspired Computation (BIC) approach
- ⚡ Xavier initialization for stable weight distribution
- 🧠 Multiple activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Linear
- 📊 Mean Squared Error (MSE) performance evaluation
- 🖼️ Visualizations with matplotlib
